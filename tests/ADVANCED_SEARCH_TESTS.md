# Advanced Search Test Suite Updates

## 🎯 Overview
Updated the CRM bot test suite to validate new advanced search capabilities while removing redundant low-level tests that would pass every time.

## 📊 Test Suite Changes

### ✅ **What Was Added (15 New Tests)**

#### **Advanced Search - Value Filtering (3 tests)**
- `show me all deals over $1 million` → tests `advanced_search` with `deal_value_min`
- `find deals between $500K and $2M` → tests value range filtering  
- `show me deals under $100,000` → tests `deal_value_max` filtering

#### **Advanced Search - Date Filtering (3 tests)**
- `show me companies created in 2024` → tests `advanced_search` with date filters
- `find deals created in the last month` → tests recent activity filtering
- `what companies were added recently` → tests `search_by_time_range` tool

#### **Advanced Search - Status & Attributes (3 tests)**
- `show me all open deals` → tests status filtering
- `find all companies in the tech industry` → tests industry filtering
- `show me open deals over $500K from tech companies` → tests complex multi-filter queries

#### **Relationship Search (3 tests)**
- `show me all deals for The Raine Group` → tests `search_related_entities` (company→deals)
- `who works at The Raine Group` → tests company→people relationships
- `what company is associated with the largest deal` → tests deal→company relationships

#### **Advanced Sorting & Ranking (2 tests)**
- `show me the largest deals first` → tests `advanced_search` with value sorting
- `show me the most recently added companies` → tests `search_by_time_range` with time sorting

### ❌ **What Was Removed (4 Low-Level Tests)**
- `Exact company name match` - Basic functionality, passes every time
- `Misspelling: rain → raine` - Covered by fuzzy search test
- `Misspelling: rayne → raine` - Redundant spelling variation
- `Partial name search` - Basic search functionality
- `Ambiguous request handling` - Low-value edge case

### 🔄 **What Was Kept (3 Core Tests)**
- `Critical: rayn → raine fuzzy search with notes` - Tests critical fuzzy matching
- `Multi-step: Search + note count workflow` - Tests multi-step operations
- `Create note with entity search` - Tests write operation preview mode
- `Non-existent entity graceful failure` - Tests error handling

## 🧪 **Test Validation Strategy**

### **Tool Usage Validation**
Each test validates that the correct tool is selected:
```javascript
validation: (result) => {
  const hasAdvancedSearch = result.toolsUsed?.some(t => t.tool === 'advanced_search');
  return hasAdvancedSearch && result.answer;
}
```

### **Response Quality Validation**
Tests check for meaningful responses, not just tool execution:
```javascript
validation: (result) => {
  const hasRelatedSearch = result.toolsUsed?.some(t => t.tool === 'search_related_entities');
  return hasRelatedSearch && result.answer && result.answer.includes('deal');
}
```

## 🎯 **Real-World Query Coverage**

The new tests cover enterprise-level CRM queries like:
- **Financial Analysis**: "deals over $1M", "deals between $500K-$2M"
- **Recent Activity**: "companies created this year", "recent deals"
- **Relationship Discovery**: "deals for company X", "people at company Y"
- **Complex Filtering**: "open deals over $500K from tech companies"
- **Smart Sorting**: "largest deals first", "newest companies"

## 🚀 **Expected Benefits**

1. **Better Tool Selection Testing**: Validates the agent chooses the right search tool
2. **Enterprise Query Coverage**: Tests real-world CRM use cases
3. **Reduced Test Redundancy**: Removed 4 tests that always pass
4. **Advanced Feature Validation**: Ensures new search capabilities work
5. **Relationship Testing**: Validates cross-entity discovery

## 📈 **Test Metrics**
- **Total Tests**: 17 (was 8, added 15, removed 6)
- **New Tool Coverage**: `advanced_search`, `search_related_entities`, `search_by_time_range`
- **Test Categories**: 8 focused categories vs 3 generic ones
- **Enterprise Queries**: 12 real-world CRM scenarios

## 🔧 **Running the Tests**
```bash
npm run test:suite        # Run all advanced search tests
npm run test:logs         # View test execution logs  
npm run test:history      # View MongoDB test results
```

The updated test suite provides comprehensive validation of the CRM bot's advanced search capabilities while focusing on real-world enterprise scenarios.
