## 📋 Active Todo List

### 🔥 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
```
[ ] Set up Phase 1 development environment
[ ] Install node-cron dependency
[ ] Create test structure for Phase 1
[ ] Write Phase 1 validation test (TDD approach)
[ ] Implement CronService class
```

### 🎯 CURRENT PHASE: Phase 1 - Daily Deal Intelligence Updates

**Status**: 🔴 NOT STARTED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Started**: -  
**Target Completion**: -

#### User Story
"As a sales team member, I want to receive daily deal intelligence updates that show what has changed for each deal, update the probability of closing, and make me feel accountable for deal progress so I'm motivated to take action."

#### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] **SETUP**: Development environment configured
- [ ] **DEPENDENCY**: node-cron installed and configured
- [ ] **CORE**: System runs daily at 9 AM
- [ ] **DATA**: Fetches all active deals from Attio CRM
- [ ] **FUNCTION**: Calls get-24-hour-update function [to be defined separately]
- [ ] **AI**: Generates AI summary of what has changed for each deal
- [ ] **NOTE**: Creates daily "note-of-the-day" for each deal summarizing changes
- [ ] **PROBABILITY**: Updates deal probability of closing (as percentage)
- [ ] **CRM_FIELD**: Updates "probability of deal closing" field in deal record
- [ ] **BEHAVIOR**: System designed to create accountability and motivation
- [ ] **ERROR**: Handles errors gracefully with logging
- [ ] **LOGS**: Provides comprehensive execution logs
- [ ] **TESTS**: All unit tests pass
- [ ] **INTEGRATION**: Integration tests pass
- [ ] **VALIDATION**: End-to-end validation test passes

#### Technical Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **package.json**: Add node-cron dependency
- [ ] **CronService**: Create `src/services/cronService.js`
- [ ] **24HourUpdate**: Create `src/services/get24HourUpdateService.js` [depends on external definition]
- [ ] **DealIntelligence**: Create `src/services/dealIntelligenceGenerator.js`
- [ ] **ProbabilityUpdater**: Create `src/services/dealProbabilityUpdater.js`
- [ ] **Integration**: Modify `src/index-claude.js` to initialize cron
- [ ] **Tests**: Create `tests/cronService.test.js`
- [ ] **Tests**: Create `tests/integration/dealIntelligence.test.js`
- [ ] **Validation**: Create final validation test

#### Files to Create/Modify
```
NEW FILES:
- src/services/cronService.js
- src/services/get24HourUpdateService.js [depends on external definition]
- src/services/dealIntelligenceGenerator.js
- src/services/dealProbabilityUpdater.js
- tests/cronService.test.js
- tests/integration/dealIntelligence.test.js
- tests/validation/phase1ValidationTest.js

MODIFY FILES:
- src/index-claude.js (add cron initialization)
- package.json (add node-cron dependency)
```

#### Current Blockers
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Need to add missing deal fields to Attio CRM first:
  - "deal-specific close probability" field
  - "total deal value" field  
  - "NPV" field (total data scientists x salary x 3 years)
- [ ] **DEPENDENCY**: get-24-hour-update function needs to be defined separately

#### Phase 1 Validation Test (Must Pass to Continue)
```javascript
/**
 * Phase 1 Final Validation Test
 * This test must pass before moving to Phase 2
 */
async function phase1ValidationTest() {
  // 1. Create test deal in Attio with required fields
  // 2. Run get-24-hour-update function
  // 3. Run cron job manually
  // 4. Verify daily "note-of-the-day" created with change summary
  // 5. Verify deal probability updated (percentage calculated)
  // 6. Verify "probability of deal closing" field updated in CRM
  // 7. Verify accountability/motivation aspects work as intended
  // 8. Verify error handling for API failures
}
```
