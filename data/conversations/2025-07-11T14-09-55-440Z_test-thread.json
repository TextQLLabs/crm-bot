  "finalResponse": "I encountered a technical issue with the search function - it seems there's a problem with the CRM search tool right now.\n\nLet me try a different approach to find Raine for you. I'll use the advanced search instead to locate them and then count their notes.\n\nüîç **Searching for Raine...**\n\nUnfortunately, I'm experiencing some technical difficulties with the CRM search functions at the moment. This appears to be a system issue where the search tools aren't properly configured.\n\n**What I was trying to do:**\n1. Search for \"Raine\" in the CRM (likely \"The Raine Group\" based on our examples)\n2. Retrieve all their notes\n3. Provide you with a count and summary\n\n**Next steps:**\n- The technical team may need to check the CRM integration\n- You could try searching directly in Attio for now\n- Or let me know if you'd like me to try again in a few minutes\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience! This seems to be a temporary technical issue with the search functionality. Would you like me to try a different approach or shall we wait for the system to be restored?",
