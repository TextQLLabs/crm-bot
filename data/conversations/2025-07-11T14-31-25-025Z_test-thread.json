  "finalResponse": "I searched for \"Rayn Group\" in the CRM, but unfortunately didn't find any matching companies, deals, or people with that name.\n\nA few suggestions:\n- Could you double-check the spelling? Maybe it's \"Ryan Group\" or \"Rain Group\"?\n- If you have any additional details (like industry, location, or contact names), that might help narrow down the search\n- You can also try searching for just \"Rayn\" or \"Group\" to see if there are similar companies\n\nWould you like me to try a different variation of the name, or do you have any other details that might help locate the right entity?",
