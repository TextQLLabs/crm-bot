This is just for note taking because I just finished the call, with Nico. For the CTO conversation with BMG on Friday. There are 3 teams that have requested this. They set all outside of IT. CTO is head of IT. And IT is where Nico reports into, which is global data engineering. Separately, there is a global analytics team and then there is a local analytics team, and then there is a finance team, all 3 of whom have expressed interest in our products. Nico has reached out, like, shared our link with, like, one of those finance teams. The finance team was excited. Some local Anthropic team was excited. Local analytics here seems to be synonymous with marketing. Marketing analytics, which is just like going through their sales data in, like, a very normalized, like, one big or denormalized one big table inside format, and just has a chat on top, which I think he thinks is gonna be, like, very easy to do. Separately, But yeah. So these are these are the some of the things there. And then, and then that's that's so the 3 the 3 more business facing teams have basically made this request for, for the CTO to, kinda look into it, to see, are we full of shit? Are we, like, kinda good? That's, like, the meta of this. So those are the 3 use cases, that we've kind of talked through and talked about about. Nico has only shared it with 1 or 2 people, so he's very surprised His perspective right now is that it's moving very quickly Claude there's so much demand for this. And yeah. You know, I'll include him on the call, but he doesn't need to be there because the most part, we're just clearing the CTO bar. Separately, Nico is the team that if we were to start a POC, would be picking up all the compliance, all the shit Like, right, it's the standard, like, data is actually a, like, a IT slash legal slash compliance team. Like, type bullshit. Yep. That's, that's that's the that was the summary that Nico gave us, and, we should go into this Friday call with a with a sales, marketing analytics use case with the finance, like budgets versus actuals thing. And maybe one more. Alright. Cool.\n\nAssistant: The request is taking longer than expected. Please try again in a moment.\n\nAssistant: Anthropic or Attio might be taking too long to reply.
