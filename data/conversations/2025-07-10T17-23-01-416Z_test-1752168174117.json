This is due to technical limitations in my current setup.\n\nHowever, I can help you with your Attio CRM tasks! If you have any text you'd like to work with in your CRM, you could:\n\n1. **Copy and paste the text** from the image if possible, and I can help you create notes, update records, or search for related information\n2. **Tell me what type of information** was in the image (like a business card, document, etc.) and I can help you structure that data in your CRM\n3. **Search for existing records** if you remember any names or companies from the image\n\nIs there anything specific from the image content that you'd like help with in your CRM?",
