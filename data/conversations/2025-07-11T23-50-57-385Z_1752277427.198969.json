    "I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, I need to clarify again - I don't have the ability to create new records in your CRM. My tools are limited to:\n\n- Searching existing records\n- Updating existing records  \n- Adding notes to existing records\n- Deleting notes\n\nTo actually create the new Ryan Craig (Lumeris) person record, you'll need to:\n\n1. Go directly to your Attio CRM at <https://app.attio.com/textql-data|app.attio.com>\n2. Click \"Add Person\" or the \"+\" button\n3. Enter the details I found:\n   - *Name*: Ryan Craig\n   - *Title*: Vice President of Analytics\n   - *Company*: Lumeris\n   - *Location*: Maryland Heights, Missouri\n\nOnce you've created the record in Attio, I'll be able to help you manage it - add notes, update fields, search for it, etc.\n\nWould you like me to help you with anything else regarding existing records in your CRM?"
