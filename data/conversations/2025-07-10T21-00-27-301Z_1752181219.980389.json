  "finalResponse": "I'm powered by Claude Sonnet 4 directly with native tool calling - not using the ReAct framework. \n\nI have direct access to a set of CRM tools that let me search your Attio CRM, manage notes, create and update entities, and perform various CRM operations. When you ask me to do something like \"search for a company\" or \"add a note,\" I can call those tools directly without needing to reason through a ReAct-style thought process.\n\nThe native tool calling approach tends to be more efficient and reliable for CRM operations since I can directly invoke the specific functions needed rather than having to format everything as text-based reasoning steps.\n\nIs there anything specific about how I work with your CRM data that you'd like to know more about?",
