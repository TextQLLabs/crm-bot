Maybe it's \"Rain Group\" or \"Ryan Group\"?\n- If you have any additional details (like industry, location, or contact names), I can try a more targeted search\n- I can also search for just \"Rayn\" or \"Group\" to see if there are any partial matches\n\nWould you like me to try any of these alternative searches?",
