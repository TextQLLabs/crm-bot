  "userMessage": "User: can you create a note on this and give me the link? on theblackstone deal: Me: Mark's company.\nThem: I'm there, Joe. That's totally fine.\nMe: Mark, something about contacts. And Blackstone. I mean, you are just like\nThem: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right.\nMe: That's right.\nThem: Maybe need to make sure to bring my my glasses.\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: To\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: the office on Monday.\nMe: Monday.\nThem: That was a good memory, Braxton.\nMe: Thank you.\nThem: Could you send me the\nMe: Shank or\nThem: Shankar's QBR for Rx benefits?\nMe: QPR Yeah. I just I have not. Been able to get to that yet.\nThem: Yep. Let Young in. Hey. Hey, guys. How are you? I'm I'm okay. Good. We're still waiting for Ben. Is that right?\nMe: For Ben. Is that right? I'm I'm\nThem: Yeah. Ben Ben is about to do it. Like, I just wrap up another meeting with Ben, so he he's gonna join us\nMe: There it is.\nThem: There he is. I think I could I got I was asking me to figure something now. So unfortunately, either, like, you know, we can, like, set a follow-up meeting you know, but in terms of, like, you know, the Toast q l you know, POC evaluation, Just give you some, like, you know, ideas. So as I mentioned, I think that we have a, a, you know, two different use case actually, different use cases. So one we, you know, we have, like, a, you know, program data program called ONIX. And collect data from our corporate companies. So you know, especially real estate, you know, the Onyx program, We have, like, a ton of data we have collected from you know, Blackstone portfolio companies. But we're not using those raw data at all at this point because you know, we we kind of like, you know, you know, not able to, like, make sense make sense of those data. So I think the, you know, original idea was that we, you know, provide specific, like, a spec of the data and expectation of the data to our corporate companies and you know, they you know, they curate their data into the the format we are expecting. And so that we can consume the data. But you know, the dynamic between a plex and our product company, like a like a you know, although, like, we own those companies, they have no mandate to comply whatever we ask them to do. Right? If I we can do, like, you know, I don't know, management change and you know, a threat project change, but in terms of, like, a technology you know you know, really the, you know, the what what has happened is that they basically share their raw data format You know, if you can figure it out, use it. If cannot, then, like, you know you know, good luck. So have, like, a, you know, terabyte of the, like, you know, terra we collected from, you know, the our poultry company. So love to use and try to make sense of those who are data from our corporate company. So that's the use case number one. Low hanging fruit, huge issue for us. And you know, we we like, we all our different effort, we you know, think about, like, you know, deploying, like, for example, Palantir Foundry. Right? You know, to have you know, solve the problem, but I think that you know, Textql, like, you know, if that's equipped to solve the problem for us. So that's the use case one. Use case two is that we have a, like, you know, you know, as I mentioned, we like, our data spending is around 90,000,000. We have ton of alternate data you know, you know, credit card transaction data and, like, of you know, formographic data, you know, like, you know, etcetera, etcetera. So we can pick up you like, you know, customer ads and you know, similar web, like, know, two type of, like, a and then you know, the you know, make sense of those data. So, you know, use case to three I'm just curious. So our primary enterprise data analytic layer is Sigma. Right? So you know, historically, we've been using Tableau, but we you know, we have a plan to sunset, you know, Tableau and then micro averaging in into Sigma. Right? And you know, like any like, you know, you know, enterprise analytic like a tool you know, in order for us to use Innoforce to, like, you know, pure data analytics, Sigma workflow, you need to carefully you know, curate data. Right? And again, like, you know, there's, like, you know, 70% of the effort in terms of, like, every you know, workflow development. And you know, it's not like a, you know, platform specific problem challenge. It's like it's, you know, problem for everybody. Right? So long story short, you know you know, Sigma, you know, come out with some sort of, like, you know, the AI power, you know, layer model to, like, you know, transform the raw data. Into the format that you know, you allow, you know, a single user to, like, feel, like, you know, you know, a Sigma workflow. Right? So I'm\nMe: School.\nThem: like, a just curious. Maybe you know, I like, you know, we we have a very strong partnership with Sigma and we are, like, a small investment you know, we have a small investment on Sigma. You know? So just curious that, you know, I can introduce you to Sigma And they like, you know, we are currently evaluating their you know, s sigma, like, feature, and it's really terrible. Right? So and, I don't know. Like, love to set up, a partnership between Textql and Sigma. So that they can potentially OEM, like, you know, Textql engine for, like, their, you know, s sigma implementation. But those are Interesting. Three yeah. We we almost did partnership in, like, the first three months of our company. Oh, really? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So what did they say then? I think at the time, Rob, who is their CTO, was working on Yeah. Rob is still the CTO. CTO. Yeah. Yeah. Anything else? Well, I was like, I wanna work on my own, like like, Texas evil type toy for a bit more. And and we haven't really caught up since then. I think, like, where we landed is basically, if we ever have a shared customer who wants us to integrate with then we would do that. But it sounds like this might be the perfect opportunity. Because Yeah. So I I I guess the you know, the way we can see it is that, you know, they have, like, a baseline offering and then, like, you know, kind of like I don't know what the good way to say, like, a plug in offering. Right? So so the what I say makes sense you guys? Or I don't think that the Sigma's existing API is the best for AI to process. But I think the changes that we'd have to do, especially if you were able to work with are, like, relatively trivial. There's a there's a side of, like, like, small like, we figured it out for Tableau. If you could figure it out for Tableau, we could probably figure it out for Sigma. Right. Because Tableau is, like, a much, lower, like, quality, like, API. I think they were just missing some functionality the last time time we checked. Although, they might have also, like, added it by this time. Yeah. Because great. Yeah. Yeah. Because of the sigma we're putting, they are so I like, it's interesting that, you know,\nMe: Okay.\nThem: the previous meeting, we talked about the Sigma API, but Sigma API historically really you know, focus on the sigma rather than you know, workbook and, you know, AI teacher Because of the Sigma ask sigma feature, they are releasing the you know, the API to for us to extract metadata and, you know, design deal maintain workbook. So it could be, I think, a good, like, you know you know, time to kind of brainstorming, like, if there's, like, any potential partnership and plug in development. Okay. Yep. That makes sense. Yeah. And yeah. I I I agree with Ethan. So the the first two things you mentioned, like the onyx and the alt data, we could probably start we could probably start working on that one, like, right away or as soon as we're deployed The Sigma one, we probably need Sigma to to help us. Yeah. Yeah. Sigma is the kind of long term feature rather than, like, a Okay. Yeah. Anything like a pen Anything else? Like, you wanna No. I think you covered the use cases. We're quite excited. We've been kinda flag like we've been putting together some mathematic research on just, like, a various categories and Mhmm.\nMe: Category.\nThem: Has been, like, a highlight of just, what we consider, like, a generation too, like semantic layers. Basically, like, your ontology graph, your not your property graphs that you auto or autonomously create for for, like, database system. So very exciting for our teams. Yeah. Could I ask about Yep. Dylan, like, I don't wanna be lewd, but, like, you know, keep pinging me for something. So would it be would it be okay if we wrap up meeting? Like, you know, I'm open you know, I have a lot of, you know, capacity tomorrow if you wanna set up you know, follow-up meeting tomorrow happy to do so. But I I need to jump\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: Yeah. Happy to. Yeah. Anyway, we're gonna work with Ben to coordinate that. Yeah. Ben, so he goes well. Sorry. Say that last part again. Do you also have to tell him? Actually, I'm sorry. Yeah. We might need it on on Yeah. Yeah. The the the the his the the stacker says the data stack diagram. Oh, yeah. We we can do it. We can just rescan for tomorrow. Don't worry. We're putting together some deliverables today. Yeah. That's not something All good. But I if we wanna coordinate a meeting, like, probably later tonight, I can go back and forth on it. Yep. That sounds perfect. I just wanted to dig into I I the three use cases you're describing sound like right up our alley. The first two basically, it's, like, portfolio operations and management as a whole. Right, in terms of visibility through Onyx and then, like, actual, like, diligence in data. This is, like, like, helping, like, the similar web, all of those things that's, like, actual, like, deal sourcing, deal seeing, that stuff. I think we've like, explored, like, both use cases, so it seems perfect. And I'll ping Ben later today to like, find some time to to to jam on it. Yeah. It sounds so amazing. I I I will my sincere apologies. I will talk to you guys later. Bye. Alright. See you. Okay. See you guys. Sounds good. Yeah.\n\nAssistant: I'll help you create a note on the Blackstone deal. First, let me search for the Blackstone deal in your CRM.\n\n:warning: **Approval needed**: Found target entity, note creation pending your confirmation.\n\nUser: dont' awit fo my coniramtio\n\nAssistant: I completed the requested actions.

Because of the sigma we're putting, they are so I like, it's interesting that, you know,\nMe: Okay.\nThem: the previous meeting, we talked about the Sigma API, but Sigma API historically really you know, focus on the sigma rather than you know, workbook and, you know, AI teacher Because of the Sigma ask sigma feature, they are releasing the you know, the API to for us to extract metadata and, you know, design deal maintain workbook. So it could be, I think, a good, like, you know you know, time to kind of brainstorming, like, if there's, like, any potential partnership and plug in development. Okay. Yep. That makes sense. Yeah. And yeah. I I I agree with Ethan. So the the first two things you mentioned, like the onyx and the alt data, we could probably start we could probably start working on that one, like, right away or as soon as we're deployed The Sigma one, we probably need Sigma to to help us. Yeah. Yeah. Sigma is the kind of long term feature rather than, like, a Okay. Yeah. Anything like a pen Anything else? Like, you wanna No. I think you covered the use cases. We're quite excited. We've been kinda flag like we've been putting together some mathematic research on just, like, a various categories and Mhmm.\nMe: Category.\nThem: Has been, like, a highlight of just, what we consider, like, a generation too, like semantic layers. Basically, like, your ontology graph, your not your property graphs that you auto or autonomously create for for, like, database system. So very exciting for our teams. Yeah. Could I ask about Yep. Dylan, like, I don't wanna be lewd, but, like, you know, keep pinging me for something. So would it be would it be okay if we wrap up meeting? Like, you know, I'm open you know, I have a lot of, you know, capacity tomorrow if you wanna set up you know, follow-up meeting tomorrow happy to do so. But I I need to jump\nMe: Yeah.\nThem: Yeah. Happy to. Yeah. Anyway, we're gonna work with Ben to coordinate that. Yeah. Ben, so he goes well. Sorry. Say that last part again. Do you also have to tell him? Actually, I'm sorry. Yeah. We might need it on on Yeah. Yeah. The the the the his the the stacker says the data stack diagram. Oh, yeah. We we can do it. We can just rescan for tomorrow. Don't worry. We're putting together some deliverables today. Yeah. That's not something All good. But I if we wanna coordinate a meeting, like, probably later tonight, I can go back and forth on it. Yep. That sounds perfect. I just wanted to dig into I I the three use cases you're describing sound like right up our alley. The first two basically, it's, like, portfolio operations and management as a whole. Right, in terms of visibility through Onyx and then, like, actual, like, diligence in data. This is, like, like, helping, like, the similar web, all of those things that's, like, actual, like, deal sourcing, deal seeing, that stuff. I think we've like, explored, like, both use cases, so it seems perfect. And I'll ping Ben later today to like, find some time to to to jam on it. Yeah. It sounds so amazing. I I I will my sincere apologies. I will talk to you guys later. Bye. Alright. See you. Okay. See you guys. Sounds good. Yeah."
