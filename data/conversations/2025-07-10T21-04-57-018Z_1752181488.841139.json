The link shows \"[Canvas: test_c - content not accessible]\" which means I can't view what's inside it.\n\nIf you'd like me to help with something related to the canvas content, you could:\n\n1. **Copy and paste** the text content from the canvas into our chat\n2. **Share the key information** you want me to work with\n3. **Describe what you need help with** regarding the canvas content\n\nIs there something specific from that canvas you'd like assistance with? I'm here to help once I can see the actual content!",
