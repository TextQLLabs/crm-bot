There are 3 teams that have requested this. They set all outside of IT. CTO is head of IT. And IT is where Nico reports into, which is global data engineering. Separately, there is a global analytics team and then there is a local analytics team, and then there is a finance team, all 3 of whom have expressed interest in our products. Nico has reached out, like, shared our link with, like, one of those finance teams. The finance team was excited. Some local Anthropic team was excited. Local analytics here seems to be synonymous with marketing. Marketing analytics, which is just like going through their sales data in, like, a very normalized, like, one big or denormalized one big table inside format, and just has a chat on top, which I think he thinks is gonna be, like, very easy to do. Separately, But yeah. So these are these are the some of the things there. And then, and then that's that's so the 3 the 3 more business facing teams have basically made this request for, for the CTO to, kinda look into it, to see, are we full of shit? Are we, like, kinda good? That's, like, the meta of this. So those are the 3 use cases, that we've kind of talked through and talked about about. Nico has only shared it with 1 or 2 people, so he's very surprised His perspective right now is that it's moving very quickly Claude there's so much demand for this. And yeah. You know, I'll include him on the call, but he doesn't need to be there because the most part, we're just clearing the CTO bar. Separately, Nico is the team that if we were to start a POC, would be picking up all the compliance, all the shit Like, right, it's the standard, like, data is actually a, like, a IT slash legal slash compliance team. Like, type bullshit. Yep. That's, that's that's the that was the summary that Nico gave us, and, we should go into this Friday call with a with a sales, marketing analytics use case with the finance, like budgets versus actuals thing. And maybe one more. Alright. Cool.\n9:49\nEthan Ding\nDo an update. Okay. This is just for note taking because I just finished the call, with Nico. For the CTO conversation with BMG on Friday.

Cool.\n9:49\nEthan Ding\nin other words: BMG CTO Meeting - Friday Prep Notes\nMeeting Context\nPurpose: CTO evaluation call to assess our products/legitimacy\nKey Contact: Nico (Global Data Engineering, reports to CTO via IT)\nStatus: High demand, moving quickly according to Nico\nOrganizational Structure\nCTO: Head of IT department\nNico's Team: Global Data Engineering (under IT)\nRequesting Teams: 3 business-facing teams outside of IT\nThree Interested Teams & Use Cases\n1. Finance Team\nStatus: Already excited after Nico shared our link\nUse Case: Budgets vs actuals analysis\nPriority: High (already engaged)\n2. Local Analytics Team (Marketing Analytics)\nFocus: Sales data analysis\nCurrent Setup: One large normalized/denormalized table\nNeed: Chat interface on top of their data\nNote: Nico thinks this will be \"very easy to do\"\n3. Global Analytics Team\nStatus: Expressed interest\nUse Case: TBD (need to define)\nImplementation Notes\nPOC Owner: Nico's team would handle all compliance, legal, and IT requirements\nCompliance: Standard data/IT/legal/compliance processes apply\nFriday Call Strategy\nPrepare use cases for:\n\n\n Sales/marketing analytics\n\n\n Finance (budgets vs actuals)\n\n\n Third use case (TBD)\nNext Steps\nInclude Nico on Friday call (though not required - mainly for CTO approval)\nFocus on clearing the \"CTO bar\"\nDemonstrate we're legitimate and capable\n9:50\nEthan Ding\nWe just finished a call with Nico from BMG's Global Data Engineering team (which reports to the CTO through IT) regarding our Friday CTO meeting. Three business-facing teams outside of IT have requested that the CTO evaluate our products: a finance team (interested in budgets vs. actuals analysis), a local analytics team focused on marketing analytics (they want a chat interface on top of their normalized sales data table), and a global analytics team. Nico has already shared our link with one of the finance teams, who responded enthusiastically, and he's surprised by how quickly this is moving due to high demand. The Friday call is essentially a \"CTO bar\" evaluation where we need to demonstrate legitimacy and capability to the head of IT. For the call, we should prepare use cases around sales/marketing analytics, finance budgets vs. actuals, and potentially a third use case. If we move forward with a POC, Nico's team would handle all the compliance, legal, and IT requirements, as they're the standard data/IT/legal/compliance team for these types of implementations.",

          "content": "\nfor the BMG call tmr morning Do an update. Okay. This is just for note taking because I just finished the call, with Nico. For the CTO conversation with BMG on Friday. There are 3 teams that have requested this. They set all outside of IT. CTO is head of IT. And IT is where Nico reports into, which is global data engineering. Separately, there is a global analytics team and then there is a local analytics team, and then there is a finance team, all 3 of whom have expressed interest in our products. Nico has reached out, like, shared our link with, like, one of those finance teams. The finance team was excited. Some local Anthropic team was excited. Local analytics here seems to be synonymous with marketing. Marketing analytics, which is just like going through their sales data in, like, a very normalized, like, one big or denormalized one big table inside format, and just has a chat on top, which I think he thinks is gonna be, like, very easy to do. Separately, But yeah. So these are these are the some of the things there. And then, and then that's that's so the 3 the 3 more business facing teams have basically made this request for, for the CTO to, kinda look into it, to see, are we full of shit? Are we, like, kinda good? That's, like, the meta of this. So those are the 3 use cases, that we've kind of talked through and talked about about. Nico has only shared it with 1 or 2 people, so he's very surprised His perspective right now is that it's moving very quickly Claude there's so much demand for this. And yeah. You know, I'll include him on the call, but he doesn't need to be there because the most part, we're just clearing the CTO bar. Separately, Nico is the team that if we were to start a POC, would be picking up all the compliance, all the shit Like, right, it's the standard, like, data is actually a, like, a IT slash legal slash compliance team. Like, type bullshit. Yep. That's, that's that's the that was the summary that Nico gave us, and, we should go into this Friday call with a with a sales, marketing analytics use case with the finance, like budgets versus actuals thing. And maybe one more. Alright. Cool.\n9:49\nEthan Ding\nDo an update. Okay. This is just for note taking because I just finished the call, with Nico. For the CTO conversation with BMG on Friday.

Finance Team\nStatus: Already excited after Nico shared our link\nUse Case: Budgets vs actuals analysis\nPriority: High (already engaged)\n2. Local Analytics Team (Marketing Analytics)\nFocus: Sales data analysis\nCurrent Setup: One large normalized/denormalized table\nNeed: Chat interface on top of their data\nNote: Nico thinks this will be \"very easy to do\"\n3.

Three business-facing teams outside of IT have requested that the CTO evaluate our products: a finance team (interested in budgets vs. actuals analysis), a local analytics team focused on marketing analytics (they want a chat interface on top of their normalized sales data table), and a global analytics team. Nico has already shared our link with one of the finance teams, who responded enthusiastically, and he's surprised by how quickly this is moving due to high demand. The Friday call is essentially a \"CTO bar\" evaluation where we need to demonstrate legitimacy and capability to the head of IT. For the call, we should prepare use cases around sales/marketing analytics, finance budgets vs. actuals, and potentially a third use case. If we move forward with a POC, Nico's team would handle all the compliance, legal, and IT requirements, as they're the standard data/IT/legal/compliance team for these types of implementations.",
