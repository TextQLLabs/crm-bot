          "content": "Blackstone x TextQL Meeting Summary\nAttendees\nBlackstone: Young, Ben\nTextQL: Mark, Ethan, Braxton, Dylan\nBlackstone's Current AI Initiative\nTeam Structure & Focus\nBlackstone Technology Innovation Team: Located on 3 floors in their building\nAI Team Composition: Legal compliance, data engineering, data science\nMain Focus: Tool building and AI product development\nSDK: Built internal wrapper around various AI services for product development\nCurrent AI Products Deployed\nInternal secure chat app (OpenAI-based)\nPDF summarization and translation features\nMultiple business units onboarding applications to secure chat environment\nNeo4j integration for database querying\nData Infrastructure & Spending\nAnnual Data Spending: ~$85-90 million on structured data\nKey Vendors:\nSnowflake: ~$7M annually\nVarious market data providers (Bloomberg, LSAC, etc.)\nChallenge: Haven't effectively leveraged this massive data investment with AI\nData Types: Heavily rely on time series financial data, alternative data (credit card transactions, geospatial data, etc.)\nKey Pain Points & Deep Challenges\n1. Massive Underutilized Data Investment ($85-90M annually)\nScale of Problem: Spending $85-90M on structured data with virtually zero AI integration\nData Sources Include:\nSnowflake ($7M), Bloomberg, LSAC, credit card transaction data\nSecond Measure/Consumer Edge credit card data\nGeospatial data, weather data, real estate movement data\nAlternative data across 12+ business units\nCurrent State: Each business unit buys data independently without coordination\nQuote from Young: \"We haven't leveraged any of those data centers with AI... that's a lot of money in my mind\"\n2. Data Fragmentation & Normalization Crisis\nRaw Data Challenge: Salesforce data described as \"extremely messy\" and non-normalized\nIntegration Complexity: Requires extensive ETL work to join and transform raw data into usable format\nQuote: \"You have to put together multiple tables to make sense of the data\"\nCurrent Approach: Data engineers manually create views for each business request\nTime Intensive: Weekly requests for new data views that require significant engineering resources\n3. Limited AI Impact Despite Investment\nCurrent AI Products:\nSecure chat app (successful initial adoption but plateaued)\nPDF summarization and translation (limited daily usage)\nNeo4j semantic search (built but underutilized)\nAdoption Pattern: \"After we release secure chat app, people really like it... but after that, it's like a plateau\"\nUser Behavior: People use OpenAI/ChatGPT extensively, but internal AI tools see limited ongoing engagement\n4. Organizational & Process Bottlenecks\nData Science Team Limitations: 25-person team spread across portfolio operations\nManual Research Process: Investment teams create PowerPoint decks from scratch for sector analysis\nQuote from Ben: \"Our data science service or value they are putting to the table, in my opinion, is very limited\"\nWorkflow Inefficiency: Data scientists spend weeks on analyses that could be automated\n5. Vendor Evaluation Paralysis\nMarket Assessment: \"In financial service, nothing out there makes sense to us. Like, nothing. Including Rogo AI\"\nProcurement Challenges: Lengthy security reviews (Rogo AI still pending after months)\nHigh Vendor Costs: Devon AI quoted $500K for POC, which they rejected\nInternal vs. External: Initially bet on building internally, now market is outpacing their development\n6. Technology Infrastructure Gaps\nSemantic Layer Struggles: Experimented with dbt metric flow, Cortex, Sigma - described as \"slow, cranky\"\nIntegration Complexity: Multiple data sources across business units with different schemas\nQuote: \"We are heavily relying on time series data for financial services... but we are kind of feeling steering heading how we can leverage data with AI\"\n7. Business Unit Fragmentation\nSiloed Operations: 12 business units operating independently\nDifferent Data Needs: Each unit has different market data requirements\nCoordination Challenge: No unified approach to data procurement or AI implementation\nSpillover Demand: Business units requesting multiple AI tools beyond what IT can support\n8. Skill & Capability Gaps\nTechnical Challenges: Struggling with basic AI implementations (e.g., voice search still in development)\nDSL Limitations: Previously unable to generate proper Cypher queries for Neo4j\nResource Constraints: Young mentioned being \"extremely poor right now\" in terms of budget/resources\nLearning Curve: Team still figuring out optimal AI interfaces beyond chat\n9. ROI Measurement & Success Criteria Challenges\nUndefined Metrics: Haven't established clear success criteria for AI vendor evaluations\nPOC Limitations: Vendors typically create \"fake success criteria\" that don't translate to real value\nValue Demonstration: Difficulty showing concrete ROI from current AI investments\n10. Strategic Direction Uncertainty\nInterface Questions: Unsure whether chat, automated reporting, or other interfaces will drive adoption\nUse Case Prioritization: Struggling to identify which of many potential use cases to focus on first\nAgent vs. Traditional AI: Recognizing need for \"agentic workflow\" but unclear how to implement effectively\nTextQL's Solution Demonstration\nCore Product Capabilities\nAgent-Based Analysis: Long-running agents (similar to deep research paradigm)\nAutomated Data Discovery: Agents automatically analyze data structure, distributions, and patterns\nMulti-Source Integration: Combines internal data with external web sources\nProactive Reporting: Automated email reports generated regularly with insights\nKey Differentiators\nTest-Time Compute: Agents run for extended periods (similar to OpenAI's o3), allowing for iterative improvement\nError Recovery: Can handle failed queries and iterate to find correct approach\nSemantic Layer Integration: Flexible approach from simple SQL views to complex ontologies\nVisual Analysis: Agents create visualizations for their own analysis, not just human consumption\nDemo Examples Shown\nReal Estate Analysis: Analyzed population migration data to identify undervalued metro areas\nCredit Card Fraud Detection: Automatically analyzed transaction patterns and identified anomalies\nRelationship Intelligence: Graph-based querying for identifying connections and expertise\nBusiness Context & Use Cases\nBlackstone's Investment Process Focus\nPrimary Goal: Accelerate investment due diligence and deal sourcing with AI\nCurrent Workflow: Investment team creates sector research ‚Üí Data science team supports ‚Üí PowerPoint deliverables\nTarget Improvement: Convert manual research into automated financial models (50-60% automation initially)\nSpecific Use Cases Discussed\nSector Research: Healthcare, infrastructure analysis\nDeal Sourcing: Automated company identification and analysis\nDue Diligence: Document analysis, IC memo generation\nPortfolio Management: Regular monitoring and reporting\nTechnical Integration Discussion\nData Integration Challenges\nComplex Data Joins: Salesforce and other raw data requires significant preprocessing\nSemantic Layer: Currently experimenting with various approaches (Sigma, Cortex, dbt metric flow)\nGraph Database: Using Neo4j for relationship mapping\nCurrent Vendor Landscape\nEvaluated: Rogo AI (pending security review), various other AI vendors\nChallenge: Nothing in financial services market currently makes sense for their needs\nPrevious Approach: Built internally first, now seeing market solutions outpacing internal development\nProposed Next Steps\nPOC Approach\nPublic Data Workshop: Start with Snowflake marketplace public datasets\nUse Case Selection: Focus on 3-5 high-impact use cases rather than trying to solve everything\nIterative Process: Build on existing data science workflows and automate them\nTechnical Requirements\nSecurity Review: Significant procurement process required for any new vendor\nIntegration: Need to connect to Snowflake and existing data infrastructure\nScalability: Must handle enterprise-level data volumes and complexity\nTextQL Company Background\nTeam Size: 15 people\nRecent Funding: $8M Series A (total funding ~$12M)\nLead Investor: Preset\nCurrent Clients: 3 large enterprises (>$1B revenue), including insurance and healthcare\nPricing Model: Usage-based, ranging from mid-5 figures to $2M contracts\nKey Takeaways\nFor Blackstone\nMassive opportunity to leverage $90M annual data spend more effectively\nNeed to move from chat-based AI to automated workflow/agent-based approaches\nStarting with public data POC could demonstrate value before complex security review\nFor TextQL\nBlackstone represents significant enterprise opportunity in financial services\nCurrent solutions in financial services market are inadequate\nTheir agent-based approach aligns well with Blackstone's complex data analysis needs\nNext Actions\nSchedule public data workshop using Snowflake marketplace datasets\nShare technical documentation and research papers\nExplore integration possibilities with existing Blackstone infrastructure\nEvaluate specific use cases for POC development",
