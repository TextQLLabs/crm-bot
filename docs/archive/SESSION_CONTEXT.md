   - For library documentation lookup
   - Status: ✅ Working

3. **Lighthouse MCP** (Not shown in initial list but available)

   - Status: ✅ Configured, needs restart

7. **Cloudflare MCP** (attempted but needs proper config)
   - Status: ❌ Needs proper token configuration

## Testing History & Fixes

### Successfully Tested
1. **Search**: Bot can find "The Raine Group" company and "Raine" deal
2. **Preview Mode**: Shows API request before executing
3. **Thread Support**: Can continue conversations in threads
4. **Note Creation**: Fixed! The correct API format is:
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "parent_object": "deals",
       "parent_record_id": "637f050b-409d-4fdf-b401-b85d48a5e9df",
       "title": "Note from Slack",
       "content": "Note text here",
       "format": "plaintext",
       "created_by_actor": {
         "type": "api-token"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Test Results
- Created test note on Raine deal (ID: 637f050b-409d-4fdf-b401-b85d48a5e9df)
- Created test note on The Raine Group company (ID: a41e73b9-5dac-493f-bb2d-d38bb166c330)

## Current Architecture

### ReAct Agent Flow
1. User sends message in Slack
2. Bot shows "thinking" message
3. ReAct agent processes with reasoning steps
4. For write actions: Shows preview with approve/cancel buttons
5. After approval: Executes action and shows result

### Key Features Implemented
- Fuzzy search across entities
- Natural language understanding
- Action preview/approval workflow
- Threaded conversation context
- Hidden bot action history tracking

## Deployment Status

### Cloudflare Workers (Current)
- URL: https://crm-bot.ahaym.workers.dev
- Status: Deployed but has limitations
- Issues: Node.js dependencies don't work well

### Railway (Recommended Next Step)
- Full Node.js support
- Original code works without modifications
- Supports MongoDB native driver
- WebSocket support for Slack Socket Mode
- Cost: ~$5-10/month

## Next Steps

1. **Update Slack App URLs** to point to deployed bot:
   - Event Subscriptions: `https://crm-bot.ahaym.workers.dev/slack/events`
   - Interactivity: `https://crm-bot.ahaym.workers.dev/slack/interactive`

2. **Test the deployed bot** in Slack

3. **Consider Railway deployment** for better compatibility:
   - Go to https://railway.app/new
   - Deploy from GitHub
   - Add environment variables
   - Get production URL

4. **Production Improvements**:
   - Add error alerting
   - Set up monitoring
   - Add more CRM actions (update, create entities)
   - Implement caching for better performance

## Known Issues

1. **Cloudflare Workers**: Many Node.js dependencies don't work
2. **MongoDB on Workers**: Can't use native driver, need HTTP API
3. **Slack Bolt on Workers**: Requires significant refactoring

## Session Recovery Instructions

When you restart this session:
1. Read this file first for full context
2. **Check the .env file for all current credentials** - this is the single source of truth
3. Check current deployment status on Railway
4. Continue from "Next Steps" section
5. Do NOT create separate session secrets files

Last action: Deployed to Railway successfully. Bot is running with Socket Mode.
