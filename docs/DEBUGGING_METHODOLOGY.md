# Debugging Methodology for CRM Bot Issues

**Target Audience**: Future Claude Code instances debugging production issues  
**Context**: Systematic approach used to solve the "invalid_blocks" error

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic debugging methodology that successfully resolved a complex production issue. The approach emphasizes isolation, hypothesis testing, and leveraging multiple debugging tools.

## Core Debugging Principles

### 1. Isolate the Problem Domain
**Pattern**: When facing a complex system error, isolate which component is actually failing.

**Example from invalid_blocks issue**:
```javascript
// Test the agent directly without Slack integration
const agent = new ReactAgent();
const result = await agent.processMessage({
  text: "can you find any notes on The Raine Group deal?",
  userName: 'Test User'
});
// Result: Agent worked perfectly (259 chars, clean output)
```

**Key insight**: The ReactAgent was working fine - the issue was in Slack integration.

### 2. Test with Production-Equivalent Data
**Pattern**: Use real API calls and actual data to replicate production conditions.

**Techniques Used**:
- Used MCP Slack server to send identical messages
- Called Attio API directly to get real notes data
- Tested exact message content that would be sent to Slack

### 3. Leverage Error Message Analysis
**Pattern**: Analyze the structure and source of error messages, not just the content.

**Critical observation**:
```json
// Error message had blocks we never created
"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"mz5ps","elements":[...]}]
```

**Conclusion**: Error wasn't from our code - it was from Slack Bolt.js framework.

## Debugging Tools and Techniques

### 1. Direct API Testing
Test components in isolation without the full system:

```javascript
// Test ReactAgent directly
const agent = new ReactAgent();
const result = await agent.processMessage(query);

// Test Slack messages directly
mcp__slack__slack_post_message({
  channel_id: "C0946T1T4CB",
  text: "Exact message content here"
});
```

### 2. Systematic Hypothesis Testing
Create multiple hypotheses and test each systematically:

**From invalid_blocks debugging**:
1. ‚úó Malformed blocks in our code
2. ‚úó Special characters in content  
3. ‚úó Empty blocks array issue
4. ‚úó Preview mode causing problems
5. ‚úÖ Timeout causing Bolt error handler to trigger

### 3. Timing Analysis
Pay attention to timing patterns:

```javascript
// Log timestamps to identify timeout patterns
console.log('üöÄ handleMention START');
console.log('üì§ Sending update to Slack');
console.log('‚è∞ Request timed out after 45 seconds');
```

**Pattern recognition**: Consistent ~35-40 second delays indicated timeout issues.

### 4. Web Research Integration
Use web searches to find similar issues:

**Search patterns that worked**:
- `slack bolt "invalid_blocks" error "An API error occurred"`
- `slack chat.update "invalid_blocks" error empty blocks array`
- `slack bolt.js "An API error occurred: invalid_blocks" error handler timeout`

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Assuming Error Source
‚ùå **Don't assume**: "invalid_blocks error means our blocks are wrong"  
‚úÖ **Do verify**: Check if the error message format matches your code

### 2. Over-Engineering Solutions
‚ùå **Don't over-engineer**: Complex block validation, character escaping, etc.  
‚úÖ **Do find root cause**: The issue was timing, not content

### 3. Ignoring Framework Behavior
‚ùå **Don't ignore**: How Bolt.js handles timeouts and errors  
‚úÖ **Do understand**: Framework error handling can cause issues

### 4. Testing Only Happy Path
‚ùå **Don't test only**: Successful cases  
‚úÖ **Do test edge cases**: Timeouts, errors, long content

## Systematic Debugging Process

### Phase 1: Problem Isolation
1. **Reproduce reliably**: Find consistent reproduction steps
2. **Identify boundaries**: Which component is actually failing?
3. **Test in isolation**: Remove complexity to isolate the issue
4. **Document symptoms**: Exact error messages, timing, conditions

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Generation
1. **List all possibilities**: Don't dismiss any initially
2. **Order by likelihood**: Based on symptoms and system knowledge
3. **Make testable predictions**: What would you see if this hypothesis is true?
4. **Research similar issues**: Web search for patterns

### Phase 3: Systematic Testing
1. **Test one hypothesis at a time**: Don't change multiple things
2. **Use production-like conditions**: Real data, real timing
3. **Document all attempts**: What was tried, what was the result
4. **Verify the fix**: Test multiple times, different scenarios

### Phase 4: Solution Implementation
1. **Implement minimal fix**: Don't over-engineer
2. **Add monitoring**: Logs, metrics to detect future issues
3. **Document for future**: Create troubleshooting docs
4. **Test thoroughly**: Multiple scenarios, edge cases

## Key Debugging Commands

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test agent directly without Slack
node test-simplified-notes.js

# Test specific components
node src/test-*.js
```

### Production Debugging
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Check deployment status
railway status
```

### Slack Testing
```javascript
// Test message content directly
mcp__slack__slack_post_message({
  channel_id: "C0946T1T4CB", 
  text: "Your message here"
});

// Get recent messages
mcp__slack__slack_get_channel_history({
  channel_id: "C0946T1T4CB",
  limit: 5
});
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Framework Behavior Matters
Understanding how Bolt.js handles timeouts and errors was crucial. The framework's behavior can cause issues that appear to be in your code.

### 2. Timing is Critical
Slack has various timeouts:
- Socket Mode: ~30 seconds
- HTTP Mode: 3 seconds for acknowledgment
- Keep operations under 25 seconds for safety

### 3. Error Message Structure Analysis
The structure of error messages can reveal their true source:
- Our code: Simple text or specific block structures
- Bolt.js: Rich text with emoji elements
- Slack API: Specific error codes and formats

### 4. Production vs Development Differences
Some issues only appear in production:
- Network latency
- Slack's actual timeout enforcement
- Real API response times

- [ ] Have you analyzed the error message structure?
- [ ] Have you checked timing patterns?
- [ ] Have you researched similar issues online?
- [ ] Have you tested your hypotheses systematically?
- [ ] Have you verified the fix works reliably?
