# Session: Search Improvements
**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Started**: 14:00  

## What We Did
- Fixed entity type filtering that was being ignored completely
- Removed hardcoded 5-iteration limit that caused premature exits
- Increased result limits from 5 â†’ 20 results for better coverage
- Fixed API response formatting (currency, URLs, status fields)

## Key Changes
- **Entity filtering**: Now properly filters deals, companies, people, or all
- **Iteration limits**: Removed safety net (risk of infinite loops)
- **Result coverage**: 4x more search results per call
- **API formatting**: Uses `web_url` from API instead of manual construction

## Risks Introduced
- **Infinite loop risk**: No iteration limits could cause runaway API usage
- **Higher costs**: 4x more search results and longer conversations
- **Resource usage**: Need to monitor API usage patterns
