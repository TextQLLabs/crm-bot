# Troubleshooting: Slack "invalid_blocks" Error

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Issue**: Bot returning "An API error occurred: invalid_blocks" for notes queries  
**Resolution**: Reduced timeout from 45s to 25s to prevent Slack Bolt.js error handler from triggering

## Symptom

When users asked the bot to find notes (e.g., "can you find any notes on The Raine Group deal?"), the bot would:
1. Send initial thinking message: "ü§î Let me help you with that..."
2. After ~35-40 seconds, respond with: "‚ùå Sorry, I encountered an unexpected error: An API error occurred: invalid_blocks"

**Important**: The error message itself contained blocks (rich_text format), indicating it wasn't coming from our code.

## Initial Investigation

### First Hypothesis: Malformed Blocks
We initially thought our code was sending invalid blocks to Slack. We tried:
- Escaping special characters (`**`, `&`, `<`, `>`)
- Removing all block formatting for notes responses
- Using simple text-only responses

**Result**: Error persisted

### Key Observation
The error message had this structure in Slack's response:
```json
"blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"mz5ps","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"emoji","name":"x","unicode":"274c"},{"type":"text","text":" Sorry, I encountered an unexpected error: An API error occurred: invalid_blocks"}]}]}]
```

This was a crucial clue - our code never generates this exact error message format!

## Failed Attempts

### Attempt 1: Remove Block Formatting
```javascript
// Removed formatSuccessMessage function
// Used simple text updates only
await client.chat.update({
  channel: msg.channel,
  ts: thinkingMessage.ts,
  text: responseText
});
```
**Result**: Still failed

### Attempt 2: Explicitly Set Blocks to Null
```javascript
await client.chat.update({
  channel: msg.channel,
  ts: thinkingMessage.ts,
  text: responseText,
  blocks: null  // Force no blocks
});
```
**Result**: Still failed

### Attempt 3: Use Empty Blocks Array
```javascript
await client.chat.update({
  channel: msg.channel,
  ts: thinkingMessage.ts,
  text: responseText,
  blocks: []  // Empty array
});
```
**Result**: Still failed

### Attempt 4: Bypass Preview Mode for Notes
```javascript
const isNotesQuery = fullContext.toLowerCase().includes('notes');
const agentPromise = agent.processMessage({...}, { preview: !isNotesQuery });
```
**Result**: Still failed

## Root Cause Discovery

### Web Search Findings
Searching for "slack bolt invalid_blocks error" revealed:
1. Empty blocks arrays are valid
2. The error often comes from Slack Bolt.js's own error handler
3. Timeouts can trigger Bolt's automatic error responses

### The Real Issue
1. **ReactAgent took 35-45 seconds** to process notes queries
2. **Slack has a ~30 second timeout** for Socket Mode connections
3. When our handler exceeded this timeout, **Bolt.js caught the timeout and sent its own error message**
4. Bolt's error message had invalid blocks, causing the "invalid_blocks" error

### Evidence
- Error always occurred after ~35-40 seconds
- Error message format matched Bolt's default error handler
- Our logging showed successful message composition but failure on update

## Solution

### Fix: Reduce Timeout to 25 Seconds
```javascript
// Before: 45 second timeout
setTimeout(() => {
  resolve({
    success: false,
    error: 'Request timed out after 45 seconds'
  });
}, 45000);

// After: 25 second timeout to beat Slack's timeout
setTimeout(() => {
  resolve({
    success: true,  // Mark as success to avoid error path
    answer: 'The request is taking longer than expected. Please try again in a moment.',
    timedOut: true
  });
}, 25000);
```

### Additional Safety Measures
1. Mark timeouts as `success: true` to avoid error handling paths
2. Don't include blocks field for notes queries
3. Wrap all error cases in try-catch to prevent bubbling to Bolt

## Key Learnings

### 1. Slack Timeouts
- **Socket Mode**: ~30 second timeout before Slack closes connection
- **HTTP Mode**: 3 second acknowledgment required
- **Best Practice**: Keep processing under 25 seconds for safety

### 2. Bolt.js Error Handling
- Bolt.js has its own error handler that sends messages with blocks
- If your handler throws or times out, Bolt sends its own error
- These automatic error messages can have invalid block structures

### 3. Debugging Approach
- Check if error message is from your code or Bolt
- Look at timing - consistent ~35-40s delay indicates timeout
- Use web search to find similar issues with Slack/Bolt

### 4. Invalid Blocks Common Causes
From research:
- Empty text in blocks
- Text exceeding 2958 characters
- More than ~20 blocks
- Button values exceeding 2000 characters

## Future Debugging Tips

### For Future Claude Code Instances

1. **Check Error Source**
   - Is the error text in your code? If not, it's from Bolt/Slack
   - Look at the block structure of the error message

2. **Timing Analysis**
   - Note how long between request and error
   - ~30s indicates Slack timeout
   - ~45s indicates our timeout

3. **Test Message Content Directly**
   ```javascript
   // Use Slack MCP to test exact message content
   mcp__slack__slack_post_message({
     channel_id: "C0946T1T4CB",
     text: "Your exact message here"
   });
   ```

4. **Railway Logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs  # Check production logs
   # Look for our console.log statements
   # Check timing between "Starting ReAct Agent" and error
   ```

5. **Common Slack Limits**
   - Text: 3000 chars per message
   - Blocks: 50 per message
   - Block text: ~2958 chars
   - Button values: 2000 chars
   - Practical block limit: ~20 blocks

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test with short timeout (10s) to verify timeout handling
- [ ] Test with long content to check character limits
- [ ] Test error cases to ensure they don't bubble to Bolt
- [ ] Verify all paths either succeed or handle errors gracefully

- `41a8c85` - Try empty blocks array instead of null  
- `e011096` - Explicitly set blocks to null

## Prevention
1. Monitor response times for all operations
2. Set conservative timeouts (< 25s for Slack)
3. Always handle timeout cases gracefully
4. Test with production-like delays
5. Never let errors bubble to Bolt.js
